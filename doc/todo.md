# To do

* Clean up the specialized compiler.

## Longer term

* Handle calls of arbitrary arity.
* Pluggable call semantics (extend the constant function to be pluggable or at least
  support Smalltalk-like late bound selector-based dispatch).
* Support for Smalltalk-like objects with flexible layout; and/or
* support for JS-like objects.
* Enable concurrent compilation.
