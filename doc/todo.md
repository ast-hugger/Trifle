# To do

* Pluggable call semantics (extend the constant function to be pluggable or at least
  support Smalltalk-like late bound selector-based dispatch).
* 'while' construct
* Devise a scheme of testing code generation.
* Ditto for recovery.

## Longer term

* Handle calls of arbitrary arity.
* Support for Smalltalk-like objects with flexible layout; and/or
* Support for JS-like objects.
* Enable concurrent compilation.
