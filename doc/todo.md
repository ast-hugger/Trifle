# To do

* Clean up compilation story as applied to a top function+nested closures bundle.

## Longer term

* Handle calls with arbitrary arity
* Pluggable call semantics (extend the constant function to be pluggable or at least
  support Smalltalk-like late bound selector-based dispatch).
* Enable concurrent compilation.
* Support for Smalltalk-like objects with flexible layout; and/or
* support for JS-like objects.
